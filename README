I. To make bash script "monitor.sh" executable, give permissions to the file: 
  >> chmod 755 monitor.sh
II. To run the bash script "monitor.sh", enter command: 
  >>./monitor.sh
 
 
 This program uses Kernel information about the processes that are running in your system from the directory /proc. 
 /proc is a virtual file system which provides information about the system's configuration and allows modifications.
 The purpose of using information from /proc, and avoiding other programs like ps, or top, is to have less overhead 
 and be quicker since our code is backrounding rather than using the CMD and redirecting from there. 
 
 
 III. Functionalities: 
 
 1) Print the name of all processes that are immediate children of init by using the
   information in /proc. 
   >>The immediate children PIDs of a process can be found in /proc/$PID/task/$PID/children
2) Choose one process from (1). 
3) Monitor the process you chose in (2). If it dies, print both its name and
   the latest value of se.vruntime you saw
   >>We check if the PID that we are monitoring is still in /proc which implicitly means that is still running, 
   if not then we report the process as dead with the latest se.vruntime info which can be found in directory: 
   /proc/$PID/sched
